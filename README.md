# Responsive Webpage

This project was created for the intents and purposes of understanding mobile responsiveness for websites and being able to execute them. We are tasked with creating a website from scratch and making sure it can fulfill mobile responsiveness standards. In this case we are assigned to create a mobile-responsive portfolio that includes an: About Me, Contact, and Portfolio Page. Minimum requirements for completing this project include:

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

The project is done through the use of: <ul>
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

 - [BootStrap4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/)

 - [GitHub](https://Github.com/) 
</ul>



# Installation

(Recommended): Highly recommend an [Open-In-Browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=techer.open-in-browser) extension to be able to visualize/troubleshoot any changes you made to the project.

(Optional): You can also install the [Prettier-Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension to aid in formating the code.
